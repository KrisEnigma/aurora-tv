# Aurora

Unofficial fork of [Moonlight TV](https://github.com/mariotaku/moonlight-tv) for **LG webOS** (C1–C5 and compatible sets), focused on high-quality streaming on OLED TVs with a remote- and gamepad-friendly UI.

## Highlights

- **AMOLED layout** — pure black background (`#000000`), dark surfaces, and violet accent; launcher, game grid, and settings popups share the same theme.
- **3.5K resolution (3456×1944)** — option between 2K and 4K; ~90% of 4K pixel area with less load on the TV decoder and lower input lag than native 4K on recent models.
- **HDR10 (PQ)** over HEVC Main10 or AV1 Main10 (when supported).
- **Tight display sync** (webOS) — tighter panel sync; see below.
- Up to **400 Mbps** on the bitrate slider (UI maximum); practical guidance below.

## Recommended settings (LG OLED)

| Setting | Suggestion |
|---------|------------|
| **Resolution** | **3.5K** (3456×1944) — best quality/performance balance for most titles |
| **FPS** | 60 or 120 depending on game and network |
| **Codec** | HEVC (H.265); AV1 if host and decoder expose it |
| **Bitrate** | **Up to ~270 Mbps** on stable 5 GHz Wi‑Fi — reduces micro-stutters and throughput drops on heavy streams (HDR, 120 Hz). Increase gradually; visual gains above that are usually small |
| **Tight display sync** | Enable in **Settings → Video → Smooth playback (TV)** after testing; reconnect the stream when changed |

On an unstable network, start at **120–180 Mbps** for 3.5K HDR before going higher.

## Tight display sync (VSync)

On the **Starfish** decoder (webOS), video PTS follows the stream’s **nominal frame rate** (e.g. 120 Hz) and **catches up** when the stream falls behind real time, with a small fixed early presentation hint.

- **On:** steadier panel vsync, less visual “drag” at 120 Hz, no extra decode work.
- **Off:** behavior closer to stock Moonlight TV.
- **Where:** Settings → Video → *Smooth playback (TV)* / *Tight display sync* — or `[video] tight_display_sync=` in the INI. **Reconnect** after changing.

## Status overlay

### How to open

- **Magic Remote:** **red (RED)** button or **EXIT** key (traditional remote).
- **Gamepad:** press **LB + RB + Back + Start** together, then **release** (opens the streaming menu).
- **Physical keyboard on the host (via stream):** `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S`.
- During streaming, the app also hints at holding **BACK** (behavior may vary by remote model).

From the menu: **Full keyboard**, virtual mouse, suspend, and quit. The compact stats bar can stay pinned on start (Settings → Basic).

### Compact mode (single line)

Example: `3456×1944 HDR H.265 FPS 120 N 2/1ms H 4ms S 1ms D 8ms TL 15ms FD 0.00% 245.0 Mbps`

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Resolution / HDR / Codec** | Current stream (SDR or HDR, H.264/H.265/AV1) |
| **FPS** | Render rate on the panel (capped to display refresh) |
| **N** | Network RTT (average / variance in ms) |
| **H** | Average host capture latency (ms) |
| **S** | Submit time to the decoder (ms) |
| **D** | Average TV decoder latency only (ms) |
| **TL** | Estimated total latency (N + H + S + D) |
| **FD** | % of frames dropped on the network |
| **Mbps** | Measured video throughput |

**Color dot:** green ≤25 ms, yellow ≤30 ms, red >30 ms (TL).

### Full mode

Same metrics in separate rows: video, audio, RTT, network/render FPS, frame drop, bitrate, host and decoder latency.

## Full keyboard (soft keyboard)

### How to open

1. Open the **streaming overlay** (see above).
2. Select **Full keyboard** — or press the **blue (BLUE)** button on the Magic Remote during streaming.

Keys are sent directly to the PC (**Ctrl**, **Alt**, **Shift**, **Win** are *sticky*: e.g. Alt then Tab = Alt+Tab). **B / Back** closes the keyboard (on webOS remotes it does not send Escape to the host in that case).

### Known issues (to be fixed)

- The remote may send **both key and gamepad events for one press**, toggling input mode while the keyboard is open.
- **Modifier combos** (e.g. Ctrl+Q) can sometimes leave a modifier stuck on the host and affect gamepad input on Windows (Game Bar, etc.) — there is mitigation, but it is not 100% reliable in all cases.
- **TV remote D-pad** on the keyboard: only navigates keys (arrows + OK); other remote keys may close the keyboard or reach the host.
- **Yellow (YELLOW)** on the Magic Remote **no longer** opens the keyboard (legacy shortcut intentionally removed).
- While the keyboard is open, avoid switching quickly between TV remote and gamepad.

## Build and installation

- **[webOS build](docs/BUILD_WEBOS.md)** — developer mode, Docker/WSL, manual IPK install.
- **[Homebrew catalog](docs/WEBOS_HOMEBREW.md)** — publishing to [webosbrew/apps-repo](https://github.com/webosbrew/apps-repo).
